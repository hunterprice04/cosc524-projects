## First Crime Mention
Part1, Chapter 3
Holmes reads the note, which was sent by Tobias Gregson, a detective at Scotland Yard. Gregson requests Holmes’s help regarding the mysterious death of an American man named Enoch Drebber, who was found in an empty house in Brixton. Holmes explains that Gregson and another colleague, Lestrade, are the best detectives at the Yard but they’re conventional thinkers. At Watson’s instigation, Holmes decides to help, and the men depart.

At the house in Brixton, Gregson and Lestrade show Holmes and Watson the body in the dining room. Despite blood splatters, the cause of death remains unclear. When they move the body to examine it, a wedding ring falls to the floor. Gregson tells Holmes that he’s contacted offices in the United States with inquiries about Drebber and another man, Stangerson, whose name appears on a letter on the body.
