## First Crime Mention
Chapter 2
â€œThe company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may
guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by
no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may
be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it
opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great
stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain
forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining
bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the
unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of
fatigue.  But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was
it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,
which raised the hair upon the heads of these three
dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo,
and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a
great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than
any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.  And even
as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo
Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and
dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and
rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.  One,
it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and
the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their
days.

- Sir Henry Baskerville (The late Sir Charles's nephew and closet living relative)
- Sir Charles Baskerville (The head of the Baskerville estate, victim)
- Sir Hugo Baskerville (victim, A debaucherous and shadowy Baskerville ancestor, Sir Hugo is the picture of aristocratic excess, drinking and pursuing pleasures of the flesh until it killed him.)

- Laura Lyons (local young woman.)
- The convict (A murderous villain, whose crimes defy description. The convict is nonetheless humanized by his association with the Barrymores. He has a rodent-like, haggardly appearance. His only wish is to flee his persecutors in Devonshire and escape to South America.)
- Mr. Frankland (Laura's father. Frankland is a man who likes to sue, a sort of comic relief with a chip on his shoulder about every infringement on what he sees as his rights.)
