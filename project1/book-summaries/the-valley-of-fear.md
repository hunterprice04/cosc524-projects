## First Crime Mention
Part1, Chapter 3

Ames the butler and Mrs. Allen the housekeeper were the only other two people whose presence in the house mattered that night.

The dead man was on his back in the study. A sawed-off shotgun fired at close range had killed him. He wore only a pink dressing gown. There was one dumbbell in the room.

Barker explained that he had just gone to bed when he heard the noise of the shot and came down and saw Douglas lying there. He blew out the candle and lit the lamp. When Mrs. Douglas started to come down, he held her off. He lowered the drawbridge at that point.

Wilson asked if perhaps Douglas shot himself, but Barker said that, while he thought that too at first, he had discovered a smudge of blood on the windowsill. It appeared someone shot Douglas and then left through the window. The man may have waded across the moat to escape. In terms of when he got there, he must have arrived earlier that day and hid.
