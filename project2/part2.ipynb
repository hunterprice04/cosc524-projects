    "To do this, you will need to generate your own custom SQuAD-compatible QA dataset using the sections of your choice, the questions, and the answers which you will add to the squad dataset downloadable from Hugging Face, [which is described in this article](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.2.0/custom_datasets.html).  Note: custom training can take a very long time on Google Colab, so be prepared for that."
