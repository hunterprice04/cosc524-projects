          "context": "\"Excellent!\" said Stapleton. \"You are perfectly right to be wary and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.\" We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a grey plume of smoke. \"A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,\" said he. \"Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.\" My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry\"s side. But then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton\"s invitation, and we turned together down the path. \"It is a wonderful place, the moor,\" said he, looking round over the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges. \"You never tire of the moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.\" \"You know it well, then?\" \"I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that\""

          "context": "\"The facts of the case are simple. Sir Charles Baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall. The evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At twelve o\"clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles\"s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here. He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master\"s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles\"s person, and though the doctor\"s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe"

          "context": "\"is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste—\" \"Gum,\" said Holmes. \"With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word \"moor\" should have been written?\" \"Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple and might be found in any issue, but \"moor\" would be less common.\" \"Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in this message, Mr. Holmes?\" \"There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others. \"Life,\" for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption—and from whom?\""

I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a \"Penang lawyer.\" Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across. \"To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,\" was engraved upon it, with the date \"1884.\" It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring. \"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\" Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation. \"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of your head.\" \"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,\" said he. \"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor\"s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.\" \"I think,\" said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, \"that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation.\" \"Good!\" said Holmes. \"Excellent!\" \"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.\" \"Why so?\" \"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has"

He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.\" \"That seems the most reasonable theory,\" said Stapleton, and he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. \"What do you think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes\" My friend bowed his compliments. \"You are quick at identification,\" said he. \"We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down. You are in time to see a tragedy.\" \"Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend\"s explanation will cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me tomorrow.\" \"Oh, you return tomorrow\" \"That is my intention.\" \"I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us\" Holmes shrugged his shoulders. \"One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory case.\" My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me. \"I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning.\" And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton\"s offer of hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to"
