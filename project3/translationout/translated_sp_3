“I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have taken him out of the head.
He has approached the dead in a mad state and finally fell here and broke his neck.”
“It seems the most reasonable theory,” said Stapleton, and gave a tag that I took to indicate his relief.
“What do you think of this, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”
My friend gave her compliments.
“You’re fast in identification,” he said.
“We’re waiting for you in these parts since Dr. Watson fell.
You are at the time of seeing a tragedy.”
“Yes, in fact yes.
I have no doubt that my friend’s explanation will cover the facts.
I’ll take a pleasant memory of returning to London with me tomorrow.”
“Oh, you’ll come back tomorrow.”
“This is my intention.”
“I hope your visit has given light to those events that have disturbed us,” Holmes hugged his shoulders.
“You can’t always have the success you expect.
A researcher needs facts and not legends or rumors.
It was not a satisfactory case.”
My friend spoke in his most frank and unconscious way.
Stapleton still looked hard on him.
And then he turned to me.
“I would suggest to take this poor companion to my house, but I would give my sister so fear that I don’t feel justified to do so.
I think if we put something on his face, he’ll be safe until the morning.”
And so it was organized.
Resisting Stapleton’s hospitality offer, Holmes and I moved to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to return alone.
Looking back, we saw that the figure slowly moved above the wide bite, and behind it that a black shield over the silver column that showed where was the man who had come so horribly.
