“Excellent!” said Stapleton.
“You have all the reason to be prudent and discreet.
I am justly reproached by what I feel it was an unjustified intrusion, and I promise you that I won’t talk about the matter again.”
We have reached a point where a narrow grassway collapsed from the road and wounded through the storm.
On the right there was a stupid and hole hill that had been cut in days of bygon in a granite quarry.
The face that turned towards us formed a dark darkness, with branches and potatoes that grew up in their niches.
Beyond a distance floated a gray pen of smoke.
“A moderate walk along this road leads us to Merripit House,” he said.
“You may save yourself an hour so that I may have the pleasure of presenting you to my sister.”
My first thought was that I had to be next to Sir Henry.
But then I remembered the pile of documents and accounts with which his study table was lifted up.
I was sure I couldn’t help them.
And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the neighbors about moor.
I accepted Stapleton’s invitation, and we headed together towards the way.
“This is a wonderful place, the moor,” he said, looking around on the flooding climbs, long green roles, with hole granite crists that shed in incredible climbs.
“You’re never tired of trouble.
You can’t imagine the wonderful secrets it contains.
It is so wide, and so neighborhood, and so mysterious.”
“So you know it well, right?”
“I have only been here for two years.
The residents would call me new.
We arrived shortly after Sir Charles approached.
But my tastes led me to explore all parts of the country, and I should think that.”
