â€œThe facts of the case are simple.
Sir Charles Baskerville was used to every night before going to bed walking through the famous Baskerville Youth Village Hall.
The evidence of the Barrymors shows that this had been their habit.
On May 4, Sir Charles had declared his intention to start the next day to London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage.
That night he went out as usual for his night walk, during which he was accustomed to smoking a cigarette.
He never returned.
At twelve a.m., Barrymore, finding the door of the living room still open, alarmed, and, lighting a lamp, went to look for his teacher.
The day was wet, and the signs of Sir Charles were easily traced down.
In the middle of this walk there is a door that comes to the mountain.
There were indications that Sir Charles had been here for a while.
Then he went down, and it was along him that his body was discovered.
A fact that has not been explained is Barrymore's statement that his master's footprints altered his character from the moment he passed the wall door, and that he appeared from there forward to be walking on his fingers.
A Murphy, a gipsy horse dealer, was in the moor at a short distance at the time, but it seems for his own confession that it has been the worst to drink.
He says he has heard crying, but he is unable to indicate from which direction they have come.
No signs of violence were discovered in Sir Charles' person, and although the doctor's tests pointed to a incredible facial distortion, so big that Dr. Mortimer refused to believe first.
