Stapleton uses manipulation to gain influence over an unfortunate woman and promises her marriage in exchange for a divorce from her husband.
He pressures her to write a letter to an old man and then prevents her from going to meet him, in order to have an opportunity to kill him.
The man uses a hound that he has treated with paint to chase the old man down an alley, where he dies of heart disease and terror.
This incident puzzles the authorities.
