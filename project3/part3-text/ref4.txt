Sir Charles Baskerville, a wealthy widower, died of natural causes. His indoor servants, Barrymore, and his medical attendant,
Dr. James Mortimer, gave evidence that his health had been impaired for some time with changes of colour, breathlessness, and nervous depression.
Local superstition had given rise to rumours of foul play, but no reason was found to suspect any.
