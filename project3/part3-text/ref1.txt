Sir Charles Baskerville was in the habit of walking down the yew alley of Baskerville Hall every night before going to bed.
On the night of May 4th, he went out as usual but never returned.
Barrymore found the hall door still open and went to search for his master, eventually finding him dead at the far end of the alley.
He had been standing by a moor-gate for some time, and his footprints after that point showed he had been walking on his toes.
It was determined he died from cardiac exhaustion, and his next of kin, Henry Baskerville, was living in America and inquiries were being made to inform him of his inheritance.
